# NoteTaker-Assignment11

The NoteTaker-Assignment11 program is... somewhat self explanetory. It's a server based application that allows you to create notes. Being a part of a server allows you to access your notes anywhere you go. 

Each note is comprised of a title and a body. Once a note is saved you see it's title is added over on the left. Clicking the title brings it up so you can read the body. While you can't edit previous notes you can delete old ones allowing you to effectively change it's contense.

## Deployment
